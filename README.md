# cropDiffusionR: Exploring the Diffusion of Maize Agriculture into the Southwestern United States

`cropDiffusionR` is an *R* package implementing functions to perform
analysis on the relationship between maize agriculture and temperature changes in prehistory.

This is the official R package for [cropDiffusionR](https://github.com/Archaeo-Programmer/cropDiffusionR), 
which contains all code associated with the analyses described and presented, including figures and tables, in Gillreath-Brown et al. 2022 (submitted): 

Gillreath-Brown, A., R. K. Bocinsky, and T. A. Kohler (2022). Children of El Niño: How Maize Farmers in the US Southwest Grew and Prospered under El Niño but suffered under La Niña. Submitted to *Kiva* for review.
    
All code for analysis, figures, and tables is in [Maize_Analysis.Rmd](vignettes/Maize_Analysis.Rmd).
